# Back End Challenge

Your challenge is to create a simple API application using Ruby on Rails (or the web development framework of your choice). Being a SVOD service, we have film data that we need to surface through an API. Your challenge is build a small sample endpoint for retrieving film data and submitting film ratings.

The application should provide the following functionality:
- RESTful endpoints for retrieving a list of films or an individual film
- Support for allowing a user to rate a specific film
- Include average rating for a film as one of its attributes
- Requests and responses should follow the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/)

Please see [films.json](films.json) for sample film data.

We don't expect you to have a perfect solution in the time allotted. Do as much as is reasonable to demonstrate your technical abilities. Please submit your work by sending us a link to a GitHub repo with your code.

Bonus points for the following:
- Support pagination
- Support filtering/sorting
- Support for only retrieving the attributes as listed in the request
- Document the end points (options that can be passed, etc)
- Provide all the documentation we'd need to run the application
