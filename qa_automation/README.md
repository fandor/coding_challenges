# QA Automation Challenge

Using whichever automation tool you think would be most effective, spend an hour or so writing regression/integration tests for our film page. While most of our films require a subscription to watch, we do have a Creative Commons film on the site: [Sita Sings the Blues](https://www.fandor.com/films/sita_sings_the_blues). You should be able to test most of our film page functionality using that film.

The film page is one of the most complex on our site, so we don't expect you to come up with 100% coverage in the time allotted.

Please submit your work by sending us a link to a GitHub repo with your code.
