# Front End Challenge

In order to put your skills to the test, we would like you to recreate one of the pages on our website! Given the included JSON (in place of an actual API call), please recreate the Festivals page (www.fandor.com/festivals).

Requirements:
1. Use any approach you think is meaningful, including but not limited to use of JS and CSS frameworks. This project is an example of your work to us, so submit this as you would submit any project in a professional setting.
1. Where reasonable, add tests.
1. All work must be delivered via Github repository.
1. Questions are more than welcome.
1. Spend a reasonable amount of time, but don’t feel like you have to finish the page to completion. We’ll continue working on it in a pair programming session.
